* chicken-notmuch

CHICKEN Scheme bindings for libnotmuch.

** Requirements

You'll need to have libnotmuch5 install, which as the moment I'm writing this is
only available in git. That means manually compiling and installing it, or
grabbing =notmuch-git= off of AUR if you use Arch linux.

You'll also need CHICKEN Scheme, obviously

** Installation

Just run =chicken-install= in this directory.

** API reference

I haven't written any documentation for this thing, sorry. Check out the source
code for notmuch.h [[https://git.notmuchmail.org/git/notmuch/blob/HEAD:/lib/notmuch.h][here]] to read the very well written documentation that the
actual notmuch folks have put together. This is a pretty thin wrapper around the
real libnotmuch so it should be pretty simple to translate.
